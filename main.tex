\item Phenotypic plasticity may, but just may, evolve and favor local adaption under different environmental factors
\item Individual plasticity is the most plausible factor to explain population responses to changing environmental conditions.

 \begin{enumerate}
 \justifying
\item <1->Despite the observed fluctuation of breeding phenology over the years, the study population of pied flycatchers breeding in Central Spain does not display any significant trend in laying date between 1987 and 2016.
\vspace{0.3cm}

\item <2-> Female pied flycatchers are highly flexible to change their breeding time. Breeding dates are not consistent among females on prelaying- period, laying dates, mating and hatching dates. These results suggest that phenotypic plasticity
of breeding events may shape environmental variation.

\end{enumerate}

\setbeamercolor{item projected}{bg=green1!100!white,fg=black}
 \setbeamertemplate{enumerate items}[circle]
 \begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item <1-> \justifying There was fluctuation of both local and global environmental factors over the study period. However, only highest and lowest minimum temperatures in April and in May resulted in strongest negative selection on late breeders.
This highlights the multi-factorial role that environmental factors may have on phenotypic selection and the importance of considering extreme values.
\vspace{0.3cm}
\item <2->Despite having negative selection on late breeders, selection patterns were not parallel to an evolutionary change in this population. There was a lack of any temporal trend on breeding values similar to what can be expected by chance.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
 \setbeamertemplate{enumerate items}[circle]
 \setbeamercolor{item projected}{bg=green1!100!white,fg=black}
 \begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{4}
 \justifying
\item <1->Given the environmental heterogeneity and individual plasticity of breeding events, the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity in this population, as an evolutionary mechanism, may produce local adaptation. However, genotype-by-environment interactions (G$\times$E) were not fully conclusive and tone down the role these interactions may have in this population.
\vspace{0.3cm}

\item <2-> Individual-by-environment interactions explain a high proportion of variance of laying date. Results suggest that role of local factors at the time of breeding may play a stronger role than global factors on genotype-by-environment interactions (G$\times$E).

\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
\setbeamercolor{item projected}{bg=green1!100!white,fg=black}
 \setbeamertemplate{enumerate items}[circle]
 \begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{6}
 \justifying
\item <1->The variation in plasticity in our population is driven by individual variation in plastic response. Moreover, this individual plasticity might be impacted by females condition altering the onset of egg laying.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\item <2-> The Spanish pied flycatcher population has the evolutionary potential to respond to contemporary climate change. However, we cannot ensure that this mechanism alone will be able to explain alone phenotypic variation or evolutionary adaptation under foreseeable events of climate change.
